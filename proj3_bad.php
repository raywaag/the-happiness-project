    <li><i>You are not who other people think or say you are.</i></li>
    <li><i>Everybody makes mistakes</i> at times, has areas of weakness, and things they want to change.</li>
    <li>You’re not who you once were - so <i>celebrate how far you’ve come.</i></li>
    <li><i>The ending isn’t written and the future isn’t fixed.</i> You’re free to change your image, and an old identity.</li>
    <li><i>Feelings are not the same as facts.</i> Don’t live based on your feelings as that will keep you trapped.</li>
    <li>Be with those who <i>see, and who appreciate, your worth.</i> And take their words to heart, and let them help to build you up.</li></ol>
